# ISTVT: Interpretable Spatial-Temporal Video Transformer for Deepfake Detection

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of ISTVT (Interpretable Spatial-Temporal Video Transformer), a transformer-based model designed for deepfake detection in videos. The project explores the interpretability of attention mechanisms in video forensics, leveraging spatial and temporal self-attention to distinguish real from fake videos. The model achieves 90% accuracy and an AUC of 0.97, demonstrating robust performance.

## Objectives
- Implement a transformer-based deepfake detector using spatial and temporal attention.
- Evaluate the model's performance on deepfake detection tasks.
- Explore the interpretability of attention mechanisms for video forensics.
- Provide insights into model sensitivity for challenging samples.

## Methodology
- **Architecture**:
  - **Input**: Video frames processed through Xception CNN for feature extraction.
  - **Tokenization**: Features split into patches and converted into tokens.
  - **Transformer Blocks**:
    - Spatial Self-Attention: Captures intra-frame relationships.
    - Temporal Self-Attention: Models inter-frame dependencies.
  - **Classification Head**: Outputs binary prediction ("real" or "fake").
- **Process**:
  - Face extraction from video frames.
  - Batch processing of frames through the transformer model.
  - Classification based on attention-weighted features.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 90%.
  - Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC): 0.97.
- **Tools**: Python, PyTorch, Xception CNN, Vision Transformer framework.

## Results
- The ISTVT model achieves 90% accuracy and an AUC of 0.97, indicating strong performance in detecting deepfakes.
- Spatial and temporal attention mechanisms enhance interpretability, highlighting key regions and frames contributing to predictions.
- The ROC curve demonstrates robust discrimination between real and fake videos.
- **Limitations**: Sensitivity to challenging samples requires further improvement.
- **Future Work**:
  - Enhance model robustness for edge cases.
  - Explore additional interpretability techniques.
  - Optimize computational efficiency for real-time applications.
